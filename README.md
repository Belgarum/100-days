## 100 Days of Python

Welcome to the **100 Days of Python** challenge! This challenge is designed to take you from a beginner to an intermediate level Python programmer by completing daily tasks that build your knowledge step-by-step.

Each day, you will tackle a new project that focuses on a specific topic, ranging from basic syntax and data structures to advanced concepts like object-oriented programming and APIs. By the end of the 100 days, you will have built a solid foundation in Python programming and created several capstone projects that you can showcase.

### Structure of the 100 Days

Each week is dedicated to a particular theme:

- **Week 1**: Basics and Logic
- **Week 2**: Data Structures and Loops
- **Week 3**: Functions and Modules
- **Week 4**: Files and Error Handling
- **Week 5**: Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- **Week 6**: Working with Libraries and APIs
- **Week 7**: Data Analysis and Visualization
- **Week 8**: Automation
- **Week 9**: Game Development with Pygame
- **Week 10**: Databases and SQL
- **Week 11**: Advanced OOP and Design Patterns
- **Week 12**: Testing and Debugging
- **Week 13**: Web Development with Flask
- **Week 14**: Working with APIs and Data Handling
- **Week 15**: Machine Learning and AI Basics

Each week ends with a **Capstone Project**, which brings together the concepts you've learned to build a larger and more complex program.

## The S.A.M. Method: Study, Apply, Master

Throughout this challenge, you'll be encouraged to follow the **S.A.M. method** for each project to maximize your learning:

### 1. Study

Before you dive into coding, take time to **study** and research the topic you're about to work on. This could involve:

- Reading the official documentation
- Watching tutorials or online courses
- Exploring example code on platforms like GitHub

The goal is to ensure you have a solid understanding of the concepts before attempting to apply them.

### 2. Apply

Once you’ve studied the concept, it’s time to **apply** what you’ve learned. This is where the actual project-building happens. Write your code, experiment, and test your solution thoroughly.

For example, on Day 1, you’ll build a Rock, Paper, Scissors game using conditionals and randomization. Applying the concept through hands-on coding is the key to mastering it.

### 3. Master

Finally, after completing the project, solidify your understanding by **mastering** the concept. The best way to do this is to explain it to others. You can:

- Write a blog post about how you built the project
- Record a video tutorial or create a walkthrough
- Share your project and explain the logic to a peer or mentor

Teaching the concept to someone else will reinforce your understanding and highlight any gaps in your knowledge.
